# Stereophonic Cumulonimbus

Stereophonic Cumulonimbus is full-stack, single-page app in homage to SoundCloud. Users can stream music, comment on their favorite tracks, and upload their own recordingsÂ 

The frontend state is managed with React and Redux and the backend utilizes Ruby on Rails. ActiveStorage and AWS work to manage audio and image assets.
